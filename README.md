- 👋 Hi, I’m @GerasimGerasimov
- i have graduate "Engineer of Electrical drive and Automation" of Tomsk Polytechnical University at 1998.
- Most of my time (since 2002) i'm developing architectures and writing a code of the embedded applications using C, C++ mostly for ARM-based platforms.
My devices specific area is: electric motor drive, excitation systems of power plant generators, operator panels (displays) and other devices of industrial control systems.
- Since 2016 i'm paying close my attention to WEB-technology applied to Embedded Devices (control by WEB, representation data from devices to WEB) for that i had mastered Node.JS, TypeScript, React.js, Vue.js, Git, CI/CD and cetera. After a lot of fussing around Debian-based Raspberry , I figured out some features of Linux :-)
- 👀 I’m interested in: 
to code my "zero-programming" IoT project
1) Node.js microservices to get gathering devices data by  standart industrial fielbuses and to represent these data like as humanreadable tags  
2) SQLite3 to write events log and historical trands of analog and bits signals 
3) frontend by React to view devices data diagram based on SVG-templates, view current and historical data trands like a oscillograms, password protected devices settrings editing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: ML, Data Science and to get best practices Front/Back-end development (Node.js, React, Vue, TypeScript)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IoT projects, to aggregate and represent complex data to analisis.
